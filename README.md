# Rogue Relic
My semestral project / homework for the basics of programming (Základy programování) course at FAMU Game Design.

## Controls
WASD / Arrow Keys - Movement
R - Regenerate the level
Spacebar - Stay in place (time still passes)
Q / Esc - Exit Game

## Gameplay
Your goal is to find a golden relic hidden in randomly generated caves.

You can mine through the walls. Each move consumes your energy.
Refill energy by collecting (*) scattered around the level.
Mine and collect gems to increase your score.

Once you find the relic, return back to the start to finish the level.

If you run out of energy or get caught by the enemies (X), you lose.

Happy exploring!
